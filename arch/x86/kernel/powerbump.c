/*
 * a note about the use of the current cpu versus preemption.
 *
 * Most uses of in_power_bump() are inside local power management code,
 * and are pinned to that cpu already.
 *
 * On the "set" side, interrupt level code is obviously also fully
 * migration-race free.
 *
 * All other cases are exposed to a migration-race.
 *
 * The goal of powerbump is statistical rather than deterministic,
 * e.g. on average the CPU that hits event X will go towards Y more
 * often than not, and the impact of being wrong is a bit of extra
 * power potentially for some short durations.
 * Weighted against the costs in performance and complexity of dealing
 * with the race, the race condition is acceptable.
 *
 * The second known race is where interrupt context might set a bump
 * time in the middle of process context setting a different but smaller bump time,
 * with the result that process context will win incorrectly, and the
 * actual bump time will be less than expected, but still non-zero.
 * Here also the cost of dealing with the raice is outweight with the
 * limited impact.
